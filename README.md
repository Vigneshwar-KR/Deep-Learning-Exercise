3. **Week 03: Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) for Image Classification**

   ImageDataGenerator class, Custom data generator, Model building and Callbacks, Wandb

4. **Week 04: Keras APIs**

   Sequential and Functional APIs, Autoencoder, Ensemble Models, Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs)

5. **Week 05: Vanilla Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Image Classification**

   Data generator with data augmentation, CNN Training and Inference, Effect of data augmentation

6. **Week 06: Improving CNN training**
