# Deep-Learning-Exercise

This repository consists of exercise and practice projects for my Deep Learning course at Technical University of Braunschweig.
The following topics were covered during the lecture and exercise sessions:

1. **Lab 00: Exploratory Data Analysis**

   Classification, Image segmentation and object detection
   
2. **Lab 01: Working with remote sensing data**

   Image acquisition, Visualization, Pansharpening, Vegetation index calculation
   
3. **Lab 02: Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) for Image Classification**

   ImageDataGenerator class, Custom data generator, Wandb, model building and callbacks

4. **Lab 03: Keras APIs**

   Sequential and Functional APIs, Autoencoder, Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs)

5. **Lab 04: Vanilla Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Image Classification**

   Data generator with data augmentation, effect of data augmentation
